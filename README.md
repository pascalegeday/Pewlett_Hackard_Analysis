# Employee Analysis of Company: Pewlett Hackard
The company, Pewlett Hackard, has requested that we run an analysis on the number of retiring employees in the company. By deducing the number of retirees per title, we are able to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Also, by providing a list of employees who will most likely retire in the near future, Pewlett Hackard can take measures to prepare for the "silver tsunami."

# Resources
* Data source: CSV files provided by Pewlett Hackard
* Software: PostgreSQl, pgAdmin

# Results
Through our analysis we created four tables to assist in determining the number of retirees and those eligible for the mentorship program.
1. Table no. shows a list of employees that were born between 1952 and 1955. Listing their employee number, full name, and the date from which each employee held certain positions. 
  * This table shows a total of 13,3776 rows of employees that fall within this age group. However, many employees held more than one position, so the exact number of employees is not relevant in this table. Employees holding more than one position shows that employees last a substantial amount of time in this company, resulting in high retention rate. However, we can begin to see that this large number may prove to be alarming for a company as it can lower employee percentage by a great deal. 
2. Table no. shows the same information as the previous table, however, shows only the employees current position and removes any past positions held by the employee. As a result, we are able to see the exact number of employees that fall within this age group. 
  * A total of 7,2458 employees fall within this age group
